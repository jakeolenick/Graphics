# Graphics
A repository for the work that I have been able to find from the last semester of Senior year of high school.

This is all the work I've been able to find from Graphics, the last computer science course I took in high school. It uses a "language" called mdl to make graphical objects. I admit that it's been a while: I'm not entirely sure how it works. However, I BELIEVE that the "mdl.java" file can be run, using any of the ".mdl" files as an argument, and it turns the instructions in that mdl file into an image. I believe robot.mdl is the most advanced image produced.
