Spheres are colored in, boxes aren't?
Spheres AREN'T colored in, or rather some of the sphere is.
Boxes are half-colored in, on the lower left seemingly.

Scanline conversion produces parallelograms, not triangles!
Sphere includes some issues:
       1)lines connecting to edge of screen
       2)one row of triangles not filled in
<<<<<<< HEAD
       3)some triangles floating off edge of sphere
Box has same issue, but there is now a stray triangle for each face
Sphere issue 1 resolved

       3)some triangles floating off edge of sphere/being jittery
Box has same issue as before, but there is now a stray triangle for each face
Sphere issue 1 resolved

Sphere realization: jittery triangles (issue 3) due to good y values, bad x
Should have finished MDL: rotx is doing rotz

Attempted fix: changed method to determining bottom, middle, and top x and y values, now more manual

Attempted fix: changed method to determining bottom, middle, and top x and y values, now more manual. Works well

GOOD NEWS: Obnoxious parallelogram issue in spheres has been, largely, solved. It was the floating point error.
Sphere still has missing row
FULL SUCCESS: no missing rows, and box works great.
Downside: there might be a tiny triangle that doesn't get filled in on the sphere?
